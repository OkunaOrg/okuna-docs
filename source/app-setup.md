#### Other issues

We're available almost 24/7 in the Openbook slack channel. [Join us!](https://join.slack.com/t/openbookorg/shared_invite/enQtNDI2NjI3MDM0MzA2LTYwM2E1Y2NhYWRmNTMzZjFhYWZlYmM2YTQ0MWEwYjYyMzcxMGI0MTFhNTIwYjU2ZDI1YjllYzlhOWZjZDc4ZWY)

#### Git commit message conventions

Help us keep the repository history consistent üôè!

We use [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) as our git message convention.

If you're using git in your command line, you can download the handy tool [gitmoji-cli](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli).

## Getting started

### 1. Install the `openbook-api` backend.

Follow the [instructions here](/api-setup.html#getting-started) and make 
sure the server is running.

### 2. Install Flutter

Visit the [Flutter Install website](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install) and follow instructions.

Once you're done, make sure everything works properly by running `flutter doctor`.

````sh
flutter doctor
````

### 3. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone git@github.com:OpenbookOrg/openbook-app.git
cd openbook-app
```

### 4. Create the `env.json` file

We use a `.env.json` file to pass environment variables to the application such as the backend endpoint.

Create a copy of `.sample.env.json` named `.env.json`

````bash
cp .sample.env.json .env.json
````

Edit the `.env.json` file  with your environment settings.

````json
{
   "API_URL": "<MANDATORY: The url of the openbook-api backend>",
   "MAGIC_HEADER_NAME" : "<OPTIONAL: The name of a header to append on every request used for access-control.",
   "MAGIC_HEADER_VALUE" : "<OPTIONAL: The value of the header to append on every request used for access-control.>"
}
````

### 5. Configure a signing key
_(Android only step)_

**Create a keystore**

If you have an existing keystore, skip to the next step. If not, create one by running the following at the command line: 

````bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias key
````

::: warning NOTE
keytool might not be in your path. It is part of the Java JDK, which is installed as part of Android Studio. For the concrete path, run flutter doctor -v and see the path printed after ‚ÄòJava binary at:‚Äô, and then use that fully qualified path replacing java with keytool.
:::

**Reference the keystore from the app**

Create a file named `<app dir>/android/key.properties` that contains a reference to your keystore:

````properties
storePassword=<password from previous step>
keyPassword=<password from previous step>
keyAlias=key
storeFile=<location of the key store file, e.g. /Users/<user name>/key.jks>
````

::: danger IMPORTANT
Although the file `<app dir>/android/key.properties` is ignored, make double sure the file remains private; do not check it into public source control.
:::

### 6. Open the iOS/Android simulator or connect a device.

**iOS Simulator**

1. Launch Xcode

2. Click on the XCode top left menu item (Next to the Apple logo)

3. Open Developer Tool -> iOS Simulator

**Android Simulator**

1. Launch Android Studio

2. Select Tools -> AVD Manager

3. If no virtual device available, click Create Virtual Device and follow steps.

4. Select the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è icon next to the device to run.

**Connect a device**

1. Plug the device

2. Allow any permission request shown in the device

### 7. Run the flutter app

::: tip NOTE
We use [flavors](https://medium.com/@salvatoregiordanoo/flavoring-flutter-392aaa875f36) to configure different names and settings for different environments.
:::

**Development flavor**

````bash
flutter run --flavor development
````

**Production flavor**

````bash
flutter run --flavor production
````

**Profile**

Not a flavor but Flutter's way to profile the app. [Read more here](https://flutter.io/docs/testing/ui-performance).

````bash
flutter run --profile
````

Help us keep Openbook going! Please look into our open issues. All contribution, no matter how small, makes a big difference.

## Official work-arounds list

Unfourtunately, Flutter is still in its early steps as a framework and ecosystem.

Work-arounds to get the app to work are something we see frequently.

This is the section where we'll be documenting the work-arounds to avoid confusion in the future.

### OneSignal iOS Build Failing

The [OneSignal Flutter SDK](https://github.com/OneSignal/OneSignal-Flutter-SDK) does not work out of the box.

In Android, the SDK Setup Guide contains wrong instructions which were adressed on [this Github Issue](https://github.com/OneSignal/OneSignal-Flutter-SDK/issues/56).

In iOS, there was no official solution to it and the fix was an absolute "hack".

The original issue for the build error is [this one](https://github.com/OneSignal/OneSignal-Flutter-SDK/issues/57) and the "hack" we implemented is found in [this issue](https://github.com/OneSignal/OneSignal-Flutter-SDK/issues/42#issuecomment-459476383) plus [disabling bitcode](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50553443/xcode-ios-build-linker-command-failed-with-exit-code) in the service extension.
